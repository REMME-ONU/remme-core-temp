Sawtooth Framework Overview
===========================

**REMME Core Team** has chosen to set-up its blockchain consensus protocol based on Hyperledger Sawtooth solutions.
Such decision was accompanied for several reasons which can be best understood by realising REMME business goals as well as Hyperledger Sawtooth key distinctions.

"Hyperledger Sawtooth is an enterprise blockchain platform for building distributed ledger applications and networks." - `Hyperledger Sawtooth <https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/introduction.html>`_

REMME is an enterprise-first solution, hence it is given that the private network consists of trusted nodes. Such environment allows us to lower the requirements for security of consensus in order to significantly speed up the transactions throughput and processing speed.

**Key advantages of the Sawtooth**

1. `Parallel transaction execution  <https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/introduction.html#parallel-transaction-execution>`_

2. `Permissions <https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/introduction.html#private-networks-with-the-sawtooth-permissioning-features>`_
3. `Pub-sub Events system <https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/introduction.html#event-system>`_
4. `Modularity and pluggable consensus algorithms <https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/introduction.html#pluggable-consensus-algorithms>`_
